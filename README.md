# RiskWatch

## Inspiration
One day, we heard of a town in California that was attacked by a major fire - many people saw the fire coming but had no reliable way of reporting the problem. We strive to solve this problem and prevent needless deaths by using our website!

## What it does
Our project allows users to report fire hazards with images to a central database. False images are identified using machine learning (image classification). Also, we implemented methods for people to find fire stations near them. We additionally implemented a way for people to contact Law enforcement and fire departments for a speedy resolution. In return, the users get compensation from insurance companies. Idea is relevant because of large wildfires in California and other states.

## How we built it
We build the site from the ground up using react, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We also created a MongoDB database to hold some of the articles and retrieve them in the website. Python was also used to connect the frontend to the database.

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into some challenges in making a ChatBot that can effectively understand a human without misinterpretations.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are really proud of our app as a whole, especially how we were able to integrate python and react into a well-built website that utilizes both machine learning and hardware!

### Try it out (production)!
* clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/dwang/RiskWatch.git`
* run `./run.sh`
### Try it out (development)!
* clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/dwang/RiskWatch.git`
* `cd frontend` then `npm install`
* run `npm start` to run the app - the application should now open in your browser
* start the backend with `./run.sh`

## What we learned
Our group learned how to construct and manage databases with MongoDB, along with seamlessly integrating them into our website. We also learned how to make a website with react, making a chatbot, using image recognition and even more!

## What's next for us?
We would like to make it so that everyone uses our application to be kept safe - right now, it is missing a few important features, but once we add those, RiskWatch could be the next big thing in information consumption.
